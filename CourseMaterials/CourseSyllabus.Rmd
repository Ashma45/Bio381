## Pre-Requisites
* A personal laptop computer that you bring to all lecture and lab meetings
    - Mac or Windows
    - all [required software packages](CourseMaterials/SoftwareInstallation.html) installed and working
    - wireless access and an active UVM mail account

* No prior knowledge of computer programming is required

## Course Content
This course is designed to teach you four things:

1. How to "think on paper" and use flow charts, logic trees, look-up tables, and data simulation to organize your ideas and data analysis.
2. How to use modern computational tools to make your analysis, writing, graphics, and presentations more efficient and attractive, and to make your analyses transparent and repeatable.
3. Foundational methods in computer programming in R (data structures, functions, control structures, input and output) that will allow you to construct computer models and to easily learn other computer languages (Python, C++).
4. Practice and practical advice to improve your scientific presentations and your classroom teaching skills.
