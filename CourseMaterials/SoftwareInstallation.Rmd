Here are the software packages you need to load onto your computer for this course. These programs work on Mac or Windows computers. They are free, safe, and do not take up much disk space. If you already have some of these programs installed, please check to make sure you are using the latest versions.

Go to each page, follow the instructions for downloading the installer. Once you have downloaded the package to your desktop or other place on your hard drive, double-click it to begin the installation. The installer will go through a number of steps. Always use the complete installation with the default choices at each step. 

Installing new software can sometimes be tricky. If you run into any issues please contact me or Lauren, and we should be able to help you out.

## Typora

Typora is a slick little markdown editor that compiles to `.pdf` and `.html`. It is great for learning the markdown language and using for all sorts of basic daily writing activities.

## Github

GitHub is a free web-based repository for storing and updating your computer code, collaborating with others on documents and coding, and hosting your webpages. We will use GitHub extensively in this course. During the first week of class, you will start by building your own GitHub repository and website, and you will post all of your homeworks and exercises to this website during the semester. It will be an on-line "portfolio" of your work. Register for free GitHub account below, and be sure to record your user name and password for future use.

[register For GitHub](https://github.com/)

## GitHub Desktop

Until very recently, you could only use GitHub from the command line, which was a bit finnicky (especially on a Windows machine). GitHub has recently introduced GitHub Desktop, which is an easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI). All of the basic functions we need for GitHub can be accessed with simple point-and-click operations. After you download and install GitHub Desktop, you will use your GitHub user name and password to set things up.

## R
R is the basic computational language we will use in this class. We will use R not only for coding, but also for taking notes, displaying code, and creating slides and graphs. During the installation, you will need to choose a "mirror", which is simply a local network from which your copy of the R installer will be downloaded. Use any of the major U.S. university sites such as Case Western or Duke. The latest version of R (25 August 2018) is 3.5.1 ("Feather Spray").

## RStudio
RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is a special editor that makes it much easier to use R and adds a number of useful features. Make sure you have installed R first before you install RStudio. Choose either the Windows or Mac OS installer. The latest version of RStudio (25 August 2018) is 1.1.456.

If you already have R and RStudio installed, you will definitely need to update them so that everything will work properly. Although it is relatively easy to update R, one headache is that it does not update all of your packages and libraries, which then have to be reloaded each time you initially use them. Here is a nice post that shows you how to update R and reload all of your previous packages automatically:

If you have some experience with R already, this upgrade should not be too difficult. Please check with me or Lauren if you are having trouble.

## Text editors
We will occasionally need to use a simple plain-text editor, and the editors that are installed by default on your Mac or Windows machines are not useful. We will need a plain text editor so that we can learn how use "regular expressions", a very powerful editing tool. There are many good text editors out there to choose from, but here are two to consider:

[download BBEdit for Mac](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/demo.html)
