## History of R
- Early languages FORTRAN, C
- S language in 1970s; programming plus stats, matrix algebra, graphics later
- Open-source R in 1992; first stable version in 2000

## Advantages of R
- interpreted (for interactive use)
- graphics, statistics
- very active community of contributors
- works on multiple platforms

## Disadvantages of R
- interpreted (slow speed)
- lazy evaluation
- functions hard to learn
- poorly documented
- unreliable packages
- problems with big data
   - subroutines coded for C or Fortran
   - Julia?

## R as a general programming language
- data structures and types
- writing functions
- for loops
- if..then, while statements
- structured programming
- annotation
- naming of variables
- using random numbers
- structured programming
- pseudocode

## Rs Four Data Types

Dimensions  | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous
------------- | ------------- | -------------
1-dimension  | Atomic Vector | List
2-dimensions  | Matrix | Data Frame
n-dimenions   | (array) |          |

## Types of Atomic Vectors
- character strings
- integers
- double
- integers, doubles are "numeric"
- boolean
- (factor)
