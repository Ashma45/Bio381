### Techniques for subsetting atomic vectors

```{r}
z <- c(3.1, 9.2, 1.3, 0.4, 7.5)

# positive index values
z[c(2,3)]

# negative index values to exclude elements
z[-c(2,3)]

# create a vector of logical elements to select conditions

z[z<3]

# equivalent to the following
tester <- z<3
print(tester)
z[tester]

# also use which() function to find subscript indicators
which(z<3)

# this works, but is overkill; just use the boolean operator
z[which(z<3)]

# can also use length() for relative positioning to last element
z[-(length(z):(length(z)-2))]

# also can subset using named vector elements
names(z) <- letters[1:5]
z[c("b","c")]


```
