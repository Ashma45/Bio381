# History of the command line
- before monitor and the mouse
- teletype for logging in and interacting with mainframe
- standard in the 1960s and 1970s
- emergence of GUI with Lisa in 1983
- Apple and Windows develop GUIs
- Apple has underlying version of Unix(=Darwin), cmd for windows
- command prompt did not disappear from standard use until ~1995 
- still used by system operators and programmers
- faster and more efficient than GUI, especially for repetitive tasks and operating on multiple files
- but dangerous; no hints and no undoing commands
- shell != command line
- shell passes commands
- numerous kinds of shells Bourne Bourne again bash

# Shell basics
- find your shell (console, cygwin, git bash)

## Where am I? `pwd`
- pwd gives you the current directory
- distinction between directory and a folder

## Anatomy of path and file names
- root = /
- subdirectory
- subdirectory
- file name
- working directory
- absolute path starts with /
- relative path starts with a directory name
- absolute paths work from anywhere on the computer
- relative paths only work from a particular directory
- /bin/Administrator/Desktop/Dropbox/myfile
- if I am on the Desktop Dropbox/myfile
- if I am in Dropbox myfile

### What is here? `ls`
- `ls` shows what is in working directory
- `ls` -F gives a slash for a subdirectory `*` for an executable
- `ls -a` shows all including hidden files and directories
- `ls -aF`
- `ls -l` shows "long" version with permissions

### Change directory `cd`
- `cd directoryName` moves down into that directory
- `cd ..` moves up one level to the next highest directory
- `cd direct1/direct2` moves down two levels to directory2
- `cd ../..` moves up two levels in hierarchy

### Move quickly to two places
- `cd /` moves to root of entire computer
- `cd ~` moves you to home directory
- `cd `  cd with no argument also moves you to home directory


### Speed up your work
- `TAB` will complete directory and file names with enough unique letters
- `UP ARROW` will give the last command used
- `history` see all of your commands
- `!5` give the history command in line #5 of history
- `!cat` give the history command for the last time `cat` was used

### Exercises
- move to the root and then back down to  your Desktop
- move to home and then back to your repository for homework
- at each step use `pwd` to look around and pick your next move
- if you get stuck, use `cd ..` to move back up a level
