### Beamer Slides - A Preview
- Better fonts and styles
- Avoids corporate odor of Microsoft
- Frequency dependent selection
- Cachet of "hard science" LaTeX users (computer science, physics, chemistry, stats)
- Completely stable and reliable appearance from pdf
- No need to bring your own computer


### Importance of Giving Good Talks
- Talks at UVM Biolunch/EEB/Comprehensive Exams/Dissertation Defense
- Talks at meetings
- Job seminars
- Teaching
- The Public

### Presentation Critique
- "uhms" and "uhs"
    - high frequency of 20/minute in guest speaker
- Too much mumbling and rushing
- Introductory material
    - too much (EEB)
    - too little (CMB)
- "Uptalk"
    * origin with Moon Zappa and Frank Zappa's hit single "Valley Girl" 1982
    * coined in 1993, starts showing up among young female graduate students at this time
        - conveys insecurity
        - sociologists think it conveys engagement
    * everyone talks this way now
    * ruins your seminar
    * Trump times - great speaker, no uptalk here!
    * be a credible spokesperson for your discipline
    * You are the expert so be confident
    * OK to be nervous just channel your energy
- Don't start your talk with a request for feedback and comments
    * Good talks - silence until you finish
    * Bad talks - sympathy questions and suggestions for improvement
    * Very bad talks - confusion and interruption questions

### Good Things To Do
- Make eye contact
- Project your voice - speak from your gut
- Use the stage - this is a performance (Vermeij story)
- Keep it short
- Use lots of slides
- Don't spend very long on each slide
    - ESA "ignite" talks 5 minutes, slides change automatically every 15 seconds
    - my talk: 40 minutes, 110 slides 
- Use sequential bullet points
- Don't read your slides
- Create good graphics with large readable axes
- Explain variables on x and y axis and units of measurement
- Control your lights and audio-visual
- Don't use a light pointer
    - point with your arms or finger
    - add a duplicate slide with an arrow or text highlight
- Figure out your own style; play to strengths, cover weaknesses

### How To Practice
- Out loud and standing up
- Videotape yourself
    - my experience at FSU
- Speak and look into the mirror
- Memorize your slides, but not your words
- Possibly memorize your first few sentences to get started
- Use your slides to remind you of your content
- Show some enthusiasm for your work
- Refine your teaching skills as a graduate TA
    * An audience to practice on every week
    * Less hassles and better performance from your class
