### Building a Flowchart in Typora

1. In Typora, go to `preferences` (under the `file` or `edit` pull-down menu) and check the `Diagrams` option.

2. In Typora help, go to `More Topics...` and `Draw Diagrams With Markdown`

3. Scroll down to `Flowchart` and copy the code snippet into a fresh Typora file.

4. Click outside the box and you should see this code rendered as a nice flow chart.

5. Now study the code to understand how it works, and then modify it to recreate your flow chart or logic tree diagram from last week. 

6. Add some text and pick a nice theme, and then render the Typora `.md` file to `.html` and push the changes to your repo.

### Creating a Beamer Presentation
1. Take one of your previously created Powerpoint slides, and try recreating it in Beamer. Note that you will need to save the images to `.tiff`. or `.jpeg` or other digital formats and put them in a folder that can be linked to from your Beamer code.

2. Spend a bit of time exploring the different themes, colors, and fonts available in Beamer, and set up something that looks nice to you.

3. The only real challenge will be to to get your images and captions properly sized and placed in the Bamer slides. I have posted some code for you to use on the [R Scripts](https://gotellilab.github.io/Bio381/Scripts/RScripts.html) page. Lauren will go over this code with you in the lab.

4. Be sure to post both your `.Rmd` file and your `.pdf` to your portfolio. For contrast, go ahead and post your original `.pptx` Powerpoint presentation as well.
