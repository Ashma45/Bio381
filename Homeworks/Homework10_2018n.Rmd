### Batch processing (continued)

1. Go to the main course webpage, and follow the link to yesterday's `Batch Processing` lecture. Scroll down near the end of that markdown file to find the code we were working on and the place we left off. The next line of code you should be entering is:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
fileNames <- list.files(path=fileFolder)
```

(Ignore all the lines of `## ""`) Read in the help system about `list.files()`, which is a very useful function for working with batches of files in a folder.

2. Finish your program by adding in the rest of the code. You can quickly cut and paste everything in, although you won't learn much that way. A better and slower approach is to type in each line (as we do in class), get it to work, and see if you can understand what each line is doing. Lauren can help explain any of the lines of code that are not clear.

3. When the script is complete, throw out the files in the `RandomFiles` folder and then run the script. It should generate 100 random data files in the folder. In the root of the project directory, you should find the file `StatsSummary.csv`. Open these files (they will open in Excel if you double click them) and make sure you understand what they contain, and how they are organized.

4. Try "breaking" the program by decreasing the range of possible row numbers in each random file, and/or increasing the number of NA values that are randomly created (what will you have to change in the code to achieve this?). Change parameters gradually until you create a data file that cannot be fit with `lm` because there aren't enough data. What happens? Does the program fail entirely or create some of the output? Are there any error messages? Be sure to delete the files within the `RandomFiles` folder (but do not delete the folder itself!), and also delete the `StatsSummary.csv` file before you run each of your "experiments".

5. If time permits, try modifying the code to add two columns to the `StatsSummary.csv`:

a) The number of rows in the original data set
b) The number of rows in the "clean" data set (with NAs stripped out)

These values should appear in columns 6 and 7 of the `StatsSummary.csv`. Remember that in the summary file, each row corresponds to a different data set, and each of these data sets will have different numbers of observations before and after cleaning.

6. For your homework posting on your webpage, copy your final R script into a single R chunk (no need to run it). Describe what happened when you "broke" the program, and also describe how you modified the code to add te sample sizes (if you get that far).
