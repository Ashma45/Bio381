### Thinking on Paper (continued)

1. As needed, continue your work with `Tyopora` to develop your flow chart and your hypotheses. 

2. If you are already an R programmer, you might want to explore the `diagram` package for much finer control over flow charts. However, the program has a lot of options and details, so it is not as simple and easy to use as the code in `Typora.`


### Creating a Beamer Presentation

1. Following the notes in class, create a short `Beamer` presentation (6 to 12 slides). Note that you will need to save your images to `.tiff`. or `.jpeg` or other digital formats and put them in a folder that can be linked to from your Beamer code.

2. Spend a bit of time exploring the different themes, colors, and fonts available in Beamer, and set up something that looks nice to you.

3. Your presentation should include the following:
- sequential bullet points
- simultaneous bullet points
- colored text
- images
- images with captions
- images with a caption overlaid (you may need to change the text color for better contrast)

4. The only real challenge will be to to get your images and captions properly sized and placed in the Bamer slides. I have posted some code for you to use on the [R Scripts](https://gotellilab.github.io/Bio381/Scripts/RScripts.html) page.
